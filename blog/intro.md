# Blogging in Japan

Alright, so this is something that is very foreign to me (Ha get it...foreign. I mean come on that was a good one. (Yes, I'm one of those people who laughs at their own jokes, especially when they happen unintentionally, and yes, I'm also one of those people who will do a set of parentheses inside a parentheses set. Because it's my blog and this is not about grammar)). I'm going to be blogging about my experiences in Japan. This blog is for future Tyler, my family, and most certainly for any of the future ICP students I chose to share this with.

## Tyler, you hate writing. Why would you punish yourself to write a blog?

Great question. I'm writing this intro right now in the second week of being in Japan and I already hate myself for subjecting myself to writing. But, I'm making a goal: my goal is to try to push out one post a week about my experiences. I've heard blogging is a good way to reflect on experiences, figured it would be fun for my family to see what I'm up to, and I feel these posts could be helpful to future ICP students (because man was I lost when I started my ICP journey). Not to mention, blogging is also one of the ways I can fulfill my scholarship requirements for UC's Study Abroad scholarship. So you know, I'm not that good of a person.

## Meat. Content. That's what matters. What will it be?

Idk. Not sure. I'll post whatever I'm feeling. It could be a random thing I noticed that week or pictures of my explorations or which [of the cheapest] Japanese whisky is the best (as if I'm qualified to judge). 

Also, props to anyone who just looked up if I mispelled whisky. No, I also did not know there was a <a href="http://www.whiskyforeveryone.com/whisky_basics/whisky_or_whiskey.html" target="_blank">second spelling</a>, see I'm already educating you on Japanese culture. If you already knew, well then you might be wasting you're time reading these posts.
